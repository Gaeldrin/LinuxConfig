# My Server Config files

It sucks to try to remember all the various things you need to do to a server when you set one up.

This project takes my primary configs for zsh and vim, and places them into a GitHub repository that can be downloaded from new boxes.

## Installation

1. Install git & zsh

        apt-get install git zsh

2. Clone down the repository on the new box

        git clone https://github.com/Gaeldrin/ServerConfig.git

3. Run zsh and run the setup script

4. Log out and back in

You should now have your (my) preferred configuration for zsh and vim. For me this includes lots of vim configurations, such as alternate ESC functionality, and vim control in the zsh shell.
