# My Linux Config files

Configuration of the terminal environment on new Linux installation made easy.

This project takes my primary configs for zsh and vim, and places them into a GitHub repository that can be downloaded from new boxes. Also contains setup script to do proper adjustments and download up-to-date versions of all necessary modules (Prezto, Solarized theme).

## Installation

1. Install git, tmux, vim & zsh

        apt install git tmux vim zsh

2. Clone down the repository on the new box

        git clone https://github.com/Gaeldrin/LinuxConfig.git

3. Run zsh and run the setup script

4. (**Optional, recommended**) Install the [Solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized) colour theme for the terminal emulator of your choice

5. Log out and back in

You should now have your (my) preferred configuration for zsh and vim. This includes lots of vim configurations, Solarized colour scheme for both vim and zsh, and vim-like control in the zsh shell.
